      I am currently a senior at WPI (Class of 2020) majoring in computer science.
      I was first introduced to programming through the Girls Who Code program,
      and have been coding ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to majoring in computer science, I am also minoring in business.
      My professional interests are primarily in project management,
      software engineering, IT, mobile app development, and leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from my professional interests, I love to cook, hang out with friends, and be in nature.
