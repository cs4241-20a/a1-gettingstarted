    <h1>Information about Sam Moran</h1>

    <h2>Self Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Hello, my name is Sam. I'm a senior (class of 2021) studying Computer Science at WPI.
      I'm also planning on doing the BS/MS program.

      <br><br>

      In my free time I enjoy gardening, baking, strategy games, and hiking. I'm from Seattle and will be taking my first semester courses online from home.

      <br><br>

      I play on WPI's club frisbee team whenever the season isn't cancelled due to EEE outbreaks or
      global pandemics.
