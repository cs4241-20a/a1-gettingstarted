This project shows that I have a grasp on the basics of HTML by using it to build a basic website frontend that gives basic information about myself and my CS knowledge.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for coloring and text alignment
- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: Added a mouseover for IMGT by using the title attribute of an <abbr> tag, created a table for my language experiences, and added a link that directs you to Rick Astley's 'Never Gonna Give You Up' music video.

### Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette and used all the colors in my website**: Created a color palette using color.adobe.com. An image of it is included in this repo.
