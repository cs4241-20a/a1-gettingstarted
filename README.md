## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added styling rules for p, body, ul, li, h1, h2, h3, h4, as well as my div containers for .working and .programming. Style rules included, background-color, font-family, text-align, list-style-type, font-weight, line-height.
- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: I used div containers to further organize my content in my ul and li items, as well as more header tags, h2, h3, h4.
- **Fixed server to host CSS files**: I fixed the server.js file so that it is able to load both HTML and CSS files in Glitch.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Syne Font from Google Fonts**: I used Syne as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
