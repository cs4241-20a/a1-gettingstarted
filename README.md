## Technical Achievements
- **Used HTML tags**: Used semantically relevant tags, including: header, section, href, footer, h1, h2, and h3 (among others).
- **Styled with CSS rules**: Added rules for header, section, footer, h1, h2, and h3 tags (among others).
- **Animated with JavaScript**: Animated a "loading bar" that bounces back and forth.  I'm new to JS, so I referenced: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_animate.asp.


### Design Achievements
- **Employed color palatte**: Generated a color palatte from the background image and used the colors in the site's CSS.  See screenshot for colors.
- **Employed a custom font**: Used Heebo (from Google fonts) as the primary font for the text in my site.
