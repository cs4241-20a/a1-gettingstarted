Assignment details

## Option 1 - Clone to computer, push to Github, import to Glitch (recommended)

8. Deploy your project to Glitch. You can do this by [importing the repo from GitHub](https://medium.com/glitch/import-code-from-anywhere-83fb60ea4875)
9. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme (guide follows) so we can find it.
9. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo.

Naming and URL Scheme
---

You must use a consistent naming scheme for all projects in this course.
If we can't find it, we can't grade it.

By default Glitch often assigns your application a random name. To change it, click on the project dropdown menu in the upper left corner of Glitch. You will then see an additional text field displaying the project name in the resulting menu; click here to edit the name.

The name scheme should be `a1-yourGitHubUsername`.
The `a1` will need to be updated to `a2`, `a3`, and so on in future projects.

This project shows a simple html page stylized with css and a color palette from [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com).

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, p, li, and h selectors. These rules included: padding, font-family, background-color, list-style-type, text-align, and color. Additionally, I created 5 separate color classes for the paragraph (p) selectors to allow easy formatting. i.e. "<p class=Flat-Navy-Blue>"

### Design Achievements
- **Used a color palette from Adobe Color**: I used a blue color palette to stylize the website monochromatically (attached as an image to code and to site).
