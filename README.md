## Technical Achievements
- **Experimented with the following HTML tags**: table, li, link, img. The table was used to display my familiarity with various technologies and platforms and I linked my personal GitHub page using the linking tag. I added an image of myself at the end of the website. I used the list functionality to list my work experience, select coursework, and non-academic activites.
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1, h2, h3, p, li, img, table, and th. These include individual color assignments, font-sizes, font-families, text-alignment, width. Each font-size has been modified from the base em to provide greater contrast in size, and different elements use different colors from my created color palette.
- **Updated server.js to support external files**: Added new cases for 'CSS/style.css' in the switch statement to support the additional file as well as the Images folder.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the IBM Plex Sans Font from Google Fonts**: I used IBM Plex Sans as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Created and used a color palette from color.adobe.com**: See the image of the color palatte in the git repository.
