This project shows a basic web page that include information about me, including my school year, degree focus, classes taken, and technical experience.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, div, p, li, img, and h1 selectors as well as a header div class.
- **Added new tags**: Added img, div, and link tags to the HTML. The img is used for the color palette image. The div is used to separate the page and add additional style rules. The link tags are used to connect the CSS file as well as the Google Font API to the site.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Used a color palette from color.adobe.com**: This palette is being used to style my site, it is also included on the site.
