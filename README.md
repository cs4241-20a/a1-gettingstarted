iStock was used for images that are not mine (images 4-7).

This project shows a gallery of images that displays different things about me. There are three images of me on the top row, the second row consists of my experiences at WPI, and the last row includes facts about me. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
1. Added colors to the horizontal lines and title, as well as centering the three on the page.
2. Added spacing in between images both vertically and horizontally, and changed the vertical spacing for each row based on the picture sizes. 
3. Made the captions so that they would stay under the image rather than extending scross the whole page
4. Made it so that the images are in a grid rather than a line 
5. Centered the div that surrounds the images and made it a specific size as well as added a margin at the bottom so theres space at the bottom of the page 

**Experimented with other HTML Tags**:
1. <img> used to display images 
2. <figure> used to contain images 
3. <figcaption> used to give images captions 

### Design Achievements
- **Created a Color Palette**: I created a color palette using adobe color wheel. the colors consist of:
    -#7A6F6E
    -#FB9A96
    -#F9E1E0
    -#7A4B49
    -#C7B4B3

- **Used Google Fonts**: I used Julius Sans One as my name, and Antic Slab as the captions for the pictures.
