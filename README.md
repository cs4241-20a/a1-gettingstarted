This project contains a simple webpage that displays information about me, such as my name, classyear, major, CS courses taken, and experience in various fields. I have also included a few additional features, as described further in the technical and design achievements.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the following HTML elements (excluding the colors and font-family for the Design Achievements): h1-h3, p, ul, div, table, td. For the headers, I set the property text-align to centered. For the p tag, I set its font size to 18px. For the ul tag, I gave it a left margin of 5px. For the div tag, I gave it a hegiht of 5px. For the td tag and table tag, I gave them a 1px solid border. 
- **Added a simple JavaScript animation**: Added a simple JavaScript animation, which works by creating 100 div elements in the div with id "sm". Then, it sets the background color of each of these divs and changes them over time in a fashion that creates a rainbow.
- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: Added the following HTML tags: table, tr, th, td, a, br, hr, h3, img, strong. I used the table, tr, th, and td tags to structure a table where I had my prior CS classes on. I added an image with the img tag and a hyper link with the a tag. I used the h3 as a smaller header, while using strong to emphasize text. The br and hr tags were used to better space out and structure the document.

## Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette and used all colors**: I created a color palette, named color-palette.png in my repo. The color palette contains different shades of green. I use these colors on my website; one for the headers (including the table headers), one for the table and list, one for the table border, one for the background color of the whole page, and one for the rest of the page's text (which is just the p tags for the most part).
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Rubik as the font for the table data and the list data, using the font-family property to set it and the link tag at the head of the document to import the font itself from gogole Fonts.
