This project shows a simple html page stylized with css and a color palette from [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com).

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, p, li, and h selectors. These rules included: padding, font-family, background-color, list-style-type, text-align, and color. Additionally, I created 5 separate color classes for the paragraph (p) selectors to allow easy formatting. i.e. "class=Flat-Navy-Blue"

### Design Achievements
- **Used a color palette from Adobe Color**: I used a blue color palette to stylize the website monochromatically (attached as an image to code and to site).
