## Technical Achievements
- **Added Bouncing DVD Logo**: I went to add an animation and one thing led to another until... bouncing DVD logo. It bounces around the screen and might hit the corner, who knows? It is implemented using JavaScript to move the element and was heavily inspired by the example on this page https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_animate.asp. This was technically challenging because I had to learn to use absolute position and other JavaScript tricks to get it to work. I also had to edit server.js to show the image (which I did with the help of this example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17624396/node-js-server-dont-show-image).
- **Added Extra Tags**: I added several tags that were not originally in the description.
    1. *img*: The DVD logo uses the "img" tag.
    2. *b*: I used the "b" tag to bold the text for "Language Experience" and "Computer Science Courses."
    3. *a*: I used the "a" tag to add a link at the bottom to a rickroll (kinda).
    4. *iframe*: I learned that YouTube will give you the html to embed a video, which is how I found out about and used this tag.
    5. *q*: The "q" tag let me add a quote, which I didn't know was a feature. I used it to add a quote that I find to be particularly humerous.
    6. *br*: I used "br" to insert a line break after the video because there wasn't one by default. Very useful.

### Design Achievements
- **Used Custom Color Palette**: I created a custom color palette using color.adobe.com and implemented it using CSS. Finding a good palette was challenging because a lot resulted in unreadable text. The header was especially tricky but I got around that by setting the background of the text to a color as well. Also, I tried using an external "styles.css" but i realized it needed more work to function with server.js, so I had to move the rules to the top of index.html. "palette.png" is an image of the palette I used.
