This project shows my proficiency in HTML/CSS, which I used to create a basic website.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the h1, p, ul, li, and h2 selectors on my web page. For h1, I edited the font size and text alignment. For p, I adjusted the left margin size and font size. For ul, I also edited the left margin size, list style type, and the top padding. I also changed the font size and top padding for ul li. Finally, for h2, I adjusted the left margin and added an underline.
- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: I utilized the a tag to provide site visitors with a link to my GitHub profile.

### Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette**: I used Adobe Color to create a color palette for the elements of my web page. The screenshot of the color palette can be found in this repo. 
- **Used the Kumbh Sans Font from Google Fonts**: I used Kumbh as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
