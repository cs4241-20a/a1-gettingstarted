## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for body, h1, h2, a, img. 
  - *body* added syles for font such as white color, text shadow for the pop effect, added a grey background to the page. 
  - *h1 and h2* have he same styles with the text decoration being underline. 
  - *a* I had to set the text-shadow to none as well as the color for the font blue. 
  - *img* I added a border-radius, position absolute so that I could then set the left and top attributes to be used with the javascript.
- **JS Animation**: My profile image bounces up and down on the screen using a simple JavaScript animation setting the  'top' attribute and updating that with an interval.
- **HTML Tags**: I used several additional HTML tags:
  - *<a>*  to show links to my sites I have worked on
  - *<sup>* to show my class of 2022 
  - *<sub>* to show the linkes to my sites underneath
  - *<img>* to show the profile image from GitHub
  - *<code>* to denote code 
### Design Achievements
- **Used the Kanit Font from Google Fonts**: I used Kanit font for the primary copy text in my site.
