This project shows a personal page by me to demonstrate some technical web development skills.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, main, figure, and html selectors. I also created classes for all my sections and used a grid layout to display them.
- **Used a Memoized File System**: I used a memoized function to read the files for the site by using a cache and taking advantage over closure
- **JS Animation**: Using Keyframes I added a button to call a JS animation to do some fun stuff on the site
- **No Divs**: I used no divs and instead opted for mains, and sections to properly convey the context of the site, and I also used alt's for all images provided.
- **Added Images**: As you can see I added a few images to the site for fun
- **CSS Variables**: I added the colors used throughout the site to the root of the html document

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Ubuntu as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Used the Adobe Color Pallete to Create the Color Scheme for the Site**: Based on the image below I created a color pallete, I drew some other colors from some other options on the side
