This project is Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Glitch. The intention of this project is to deploy a webpage that will be used for this term.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I applied different background colors to the body, h1, h2, selected text, and the tables. This was new for me, definitely room for improvement.
- **Updated the server.js to include the .css file**: Updated the cases to support style.css file.
- **Used Tables**: Tables were used to represent data regarding courses taken and experience with different technologies.
- **Used Links**: Links were used to reference my LinkedIn and the WPI Computer Science Course Catalog.

### Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette from Adobe**: Not the most pretty setup, but I enjoy the colors I used. The webpage was colored and highlighted using values from the selected color palette.
- **Used the Roboto Mono Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto Mono for the webpage.
