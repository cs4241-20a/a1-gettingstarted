In this project, I designed a website using HTML/CSS and JavaScript that describes a little bit about myself.

# Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for body, h1, h2, hr, table, th, td, li, p, button.

- **Experimented with HTML tags**: Used the hr, table, th, td, button, img, ol, ul, a tags.

- **Included JavaScript Animation of Moving Train**: Implemented a moving image of a train animation by utilizing JavaScript. By following a reference I found on about JavaScript animation, I was able to gather enough information to help me implement my desired animation. The animation of the moving train will activate when the user clicks on the 'Click Here' button.

# Design Achievements
- **Used color.adobe.com for Creating Color Palette**: Used color.adobe.com to help me pick a color palette to use in my website. I was able to incorporate all 5 colors into my website and you can view the used color palette under the file: color-wheel.png.

- **Used the Slabo and Teko Font from Google Fonts**: I used Teko as the font for my h1 tag and used Slabo for the primary copy text in my website.
