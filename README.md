This project shows some of my basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS knowledge. It's a simple webpage that lists my previous programming knowledge. The server.js was written by Charlie Roberts. The image is from unsplash.com, which hosts free images. I've done all of the achievements listed in the homework writeup. This project will also be hosted on the glitch url above.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, ul, h1, h2, image, body, div container, and div animated. The h1 rule simply changes the color of the larger title heading. The h2 rule changes the font-size and the color of the smaller headings. The p rule changes the text to justify alignment. The .image rule sets up the image with the size and centers it also provides the opacity and filter. The img:hover just applys the horizontal flip on mouse hover. The ul rule changes the color, and the font-size of the entire list. The body rule changes the entire page background color, the text that isn't already stylized color, adds in the Google font, and changes the font-size of the page. The container tag is specifically for the container for the box animation at the bottom of the page, and the animated tag is for the box itself inside the container.
- **Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page**: Added a JavaScript animation of a block moving to the bottom of the page. Also added a mouseover to the image on the top of the page that horizontally flips the image.
- **Experimented with HTML tags**: Used li, ul, p, link, script, meta, a and img. (Image taken from Unsplash.com free images.). A used to create a link on the image to its source. Script used to point to my javascript animation file. Link used to link the stylesheet to the page, and source the google font.

### Design Achievements
- **Color Pallette**: Created a color palette using color.adobe.com. These colors are used in the css that was created, and the picture of the color wheel is added to the repo.
- **Used the Ubuntu Mono Font from Google Fonts**: I used Ubuntu mono as the font for the primary text in my site.

### Other
- **Added alt tags**: Added alt tags with comments to each important element that should have it.
