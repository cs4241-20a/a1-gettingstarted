This project shows a background of my time here at WPI, both academically and socially. The page consists of header, and a navigation bar which links the user to each section on the page. The "Meet Me" section contiains a picture of myself and a small introduction about me. The "Techinical Skills" section describes the different classes I've taken, skill levels I have, and some of my past projects and work. The "Campus Involvement" section show cases some of the organizations I'm involved in at WPI and the images expand when you hover over them. Lastly, the "Fun Facts" section describes some of my favorite movies, books, and songs, and provides link to each that are listed (ie. links to IMbD pages, book or author sites, or YouTube videos).

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**:
1. Set the font-family of text within the page using the Google fonts that I imported
2. Set the background-color of the "Technical Skills" and "Fun Facts" sections
3. Removed the outlines of the buttons so that they would blend into the navigation bar
4. Removed the text decoration of the button links so that they would blend into the navigation bar
5. Set a border-radius on the images so that they would appear in a circle

- **Experiment with HTML tags**:
1. Used links to take the user to different sections of the pages itself, as well as out of the page using the links in the "Fun Facts" section
2. Used images to showcase pictures of myself and campus involvement
3. Used buttons to create links to take the user to different sections of the site

1. I created a color palette using Adobe colorwheel and implmented these colors throught the chapter

    #5867AD - used for the background of the navigation bar
    #7385E0 - used for bigger text headers
