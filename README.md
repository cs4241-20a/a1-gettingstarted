This project demonstrates basic html, css, and javascript animation

#### Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the a, table, body, h1 and h2 tags, and many others
- **Simple JS Animation**: Animated swan image to loop across the page in the background
- **Additional HTML tags**: using table, link to CS home page, and swan image

#### Design Achievements
- **Adobe Color Palette**: I generated a color palette on color.adobe.com and styled my elements with it
- **Google Font Implemented**: Roboto Mono font used as the primary font for my site

#### Notes
- Code snippet from: http://www.codeblocq.com/2016/05/Two-Ways-of-Creating-an-Animation-Loop-in-JavaScript/ was modified so that swan would loop through page instead of bouncing off of edges
