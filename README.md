Jenna Galli https://a1-jegalli22.glitch.me/

This project contains an edited HTML page with scholarly information about me, and a simple node js server 
to run to webpage. 

Assignment details:

1. Fork this repo and clone it to your computer, make changes locally on your computer, push the repo onto GitHub, and then import your GitHub repo into Glitch.
2. Edit `index.html` to show the following information about you:
    * your name and class at WPI (e.g. class of 2020) Note: Do not put any contact or personal information that you do not potentially want other people outside of this class to see.
    * your major(s) and minor(s)
    * previous computer science courses that you have taken at WPI
    * your experience with the following technologies and methods (none, some, a lot)
        * HTML
        * CSS
        * Java
        * JavaScript
        * Ruby
        * Python
        * unit testing
4. Complete technical and/or design achievements (see below).
5. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly. You can do this locally by simply running `node server.js` from within the assignment directory.
6. Commit and push all your changes to GitHub. 
7. Deploy your project to Glitch. You can do this by [importing the repo from GitHub](https://medium.com/glitch/import-code-from-anywhere-83fb60ea4875)



## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1, and h4.
- **Java Script Animation**: At the bottom of the page, an animation was added that displays a box moving
                            from one corner of a container to another. I used code from this link https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_animate.asp to create the animation. I changed the way in which the animation moves as well as the colors of the animation. 
- **Experimentation with other HTML tags**: Added a button to launch the animation. Added a box chart to describe
                                            my experience level with each technology. I used code from this link https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_skill_bar.asp for the box chart. I first created a container which would be shown as a bar and then customized each skill to have it's own color filling up this bar to the appropriate precent level.  

### Design Achievements
- **Color Palette**: I used a specific color palette from [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com). Every 
                    color was used in my bar chart CSS code under each technology's class. To find an image of my color palette, check the associated files with this project.
