This project shows a basic website that contains text with some formatting.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added style rules for padding, text-decoration, text-align, border and font-family.
  Padding was added in order to give each section of the document a large presence.
  Text decoration was added for the overall main heading of the page to highlight its importance.
  Text align was added to the introduction section in order to center important information on the page.
  A border was added to draw attention to the experience section of the page as well as compliment its color scheme.
  Font family was added in order to help style and distinguish the text of each section.

-  **Experiment with HTML Tags**: Added extra HTML tags for ul, ol, q, small, em.
  An unordered list tag was added for the programming languages section as there was no reason to order them.
  An ordered list tag was added for the course experiences section to list the courses in the order they were taken.
  A quotation tag was added for the phrase "I am a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute" to have it be read as a statement as if I were telling the visitor to my site.
  Small tags were added in order to show a difference between the text for some and none vs a lot as these related to experience. This would help distinguish the languages with which I have a lot of experience.
  Emphasis tags were added in order to show that the text: Computer Science Courses and Programming Languages were list headers and to differentiate them from other text.

### Design Achievements
- **Create a Color Palette**: Using color.adobe.com, I created a custom color palette for my website.
  In order to implement this custom color palette and include each color in my website I created sections using HTML tags.
  I divided the content which was split amongst personal information and my experience into two sections which could be colored separately using background-color style rules.
  I put the experience section so that it filled into the introduction section in order to create a distinct center with the colors growing darker as it approached the center.
  I made the body a third color again using background-color, making an outermost rectangle of the lightest blue shade.
  Then, I used the remaining two colors as text colors using the CSS style rule color.
  The exact colors and color wheel are included in a screenshot added to my repository.
