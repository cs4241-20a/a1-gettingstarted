This project shows that I am able to create a basic website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also shows the ability to use Git/GitHub to manage code revisions. Finally, it shows the ability to deploy the site to a hosting provider (Glitch).

## Technical Achievements
- **CSS Page Styles**:
  1. Made the text occupy the middle 50% of the page, with a quarter margin on each side.
  2. Added a dotted bottom border to the table header.
  3. Centered the table display toggle button.
  
- **JavaScript Animation**: When the button at the bottom is clicked, it will hide the experience table, and when clicked again it will show it.

- **Other HTML Tags**:
  1. `<table>` - Used to create the table to show experiences in technologies.
  2. `<br>` - Used to help format some of the text near the top to add vertical spacing.
  3. `<i>` - Used to italicize the text containing my major.
  4. `<button>` - Used to style/format the button at the bottom of the page. (Since it's JS, anything could have worked because it's using `onclick`, not a link or anything.)
  5. `<thead>` - Used to add the bold format header to the top of the table with the column titles.
