This project shows a basic website with simple HTML, JavaScript, and CSS hosted on Glitch. It also displays a basic use of basic git/github. It also contains extra technical and design achievements. This project **does not** show any common sense in design though, in fact it does the opposite.

    1. img: Changed width and height of picture

    4. body: Changed font family
    5. h1: Changed font weight

    1. Frog image moves back and forth in a fun and exciting way
    2. Text changes color rapidly between two lovely complementary colors
