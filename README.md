This project shows a website that contains a quick personal introduction as well as some references for anyone interested to see my skills as a programmer. It uses a combination of html/css as well as some JavaScript and node.js (to host the server) in order to achieve this.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1, h2, h3, table, th, td, and img selectors. Also centered the content so it doesn't look ugly.
- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: Used the \<link\>, \<img\>, <address\>, \<a\>, \<br\>, \<ol\>, \<ul\>, \<li\>, \<abbr\>, \<table\>, \<tr\>, \<th\>, and \<td\> tags throughout the webpage.
- **Edited server.js**: Edited the server.js file in order to allow both glitch and any other server to display the correct CSS file and hosted image. Without these edits neither would display any formatting or files other than 'index.html'.
- **Added simple JavaScript animation:** Made my picture spin because it's silly and I wanted to get this acheivement without throwing another image into the html :)

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site, as can be seen in 'style.css'
- **Created and used a color palette using color.adobe.com**: I implemented all the colors generated by the adobe website using 'style.css' for the background color, header color, table color, and image border color. Screenshot can be found in the assets folder.
