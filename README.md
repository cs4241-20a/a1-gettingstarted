CSS
1. I use "color" element to change colors of the text.
2. I create an ID for the content (all text except title) and then adds "margin-left" to it to move it to right.
3. I create a class, "center", to aligh the text in center, and applied it to the second title "experience."
4. I create two class, "dropdown" and "dropdown-content" to modify "Work Experience." When the mouse hovers dropdown block, the drop-down contents will show in a block
5. I used different display (when hovers, "dropdown-content" use block; the "Work experience" itself I used inline-block; and when the mouse DOES NOT hover, display will be none for the contents.
5.2 I added a block shadow for it, with shadow showing and its color using rgba, with color black but alpha 0.1 (10% transparancy
5.3 I added padding for the contents to look prettier

JAVASCRIPT ANIMATION
I create a button, and a line; when the button is onclick, MyAni() will get called, and this function will animate the line.
The function creates default position 0 and the get the element by getting id = animation; then it calls frame to start the animation by moving down the text (adding px to its top
frame by frame.

HTML TAGS
1. use span for Work experience, so now it does not occupy the whole line
2. used a for adding a line called "this is google" with a http link to google
3. add id to div, which is the content part (everything except title)
4. add class tag to drop-down menu (work experience)
5. add h4 and add class called "smaller-font" to it to set the font 13px.
6. add a button when creating animation for the text (last line)

DESIGN
1. Apply Tangerine font from google by adding a link (API) to refer to it and then add a style for body: all text will be in this font.
2. Color. My palatte is blue and it goes from darkest to lighter, from class = blue1 to blue5. I applied blue5 to background color, blue2 to title, blue3 to paragraphs and blue4 to "this is google".
It may be not very clear to see but I did use all of them.
