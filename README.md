Ann Jicha https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ahjicha-a1-gettingstarted

This project shows a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
 I added rules for:
 the h1 and h2 selectors (font-family, color, font-size, text-align)
 the body tag (background-color)
 the p tag (color, font-family)
 the li tag (color)
 the a tag (color), along with a:hover (color, text-decoration) so that when a user hovers their mouse over the link, it changes color
 the table tag (background-color)
 This technical challenge was an ideal challenge to refresh how CSS could be used to style the webpage.

- **Experimented with HTML**: 
I added a link using the &#60;a&#62; tag.
I added a table using the &#60;table&#62; tag, the &#60;th&#62; tag, and the &#60;tr&#62; tag. I also utilized a border modifier.
I added the &#60;b&#62; tag 

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Lora Font from Google Fonts**: 
I used the Google Font Lora as the primary font on my website.
I have not previously imported fonts into my website, so this was handy to learn.

-**Used a Color Scheme**:
I created a monochromatic green color scheme for my website. The color scheme also appears in this repository as colorScheme.png. 
I still have a lot to learn about design, but playing with color was useful as a starting place.
