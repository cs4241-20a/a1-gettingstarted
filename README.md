## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added colors for background, text, links, and tables. Styled table with text-align and borders.
- **Used HTML tags**: Used a "table" in CS Experience. Used "a" to link previous classes to WPI's course descriptions.

### Design Achievements
- **Used Adobe color palette**: I used an analogous color palette consisting of #6F0EE6 (the h1 color), #0E1EE6 (the main text color), #46AFFA (the background color), #07E6CF (the table background), and #5CFA94 (the links and table header backgrounds).
