## Technical Achievements
I created a graph, using the table class, to display my skillset in various languages and CS related achievements. I also created a table to showcase some of the classes I have previously taken related to Computer Science. I have also utlilized the <a> tag for a hyperlink that opens to a new window (directed to my LinkedIn),  underlining, bolding and horizontal line breaks.
I decided to add rules to h1,h2, body, table, and graph. These rules included styles affecting font-family, text-align, background color, text color, font-size, and padding. 
I created a simple slide in animaton which I used for both my h1 and h2 which move those fields from the right side of the page to the left when the page opens. 

### Design Achievements
I created a color palette using color.adobe.com that utilized #C9D5C4, #9782F5, #F5EDAE, #F58ED2 and #76EAF5. (screenshot located in the repo)
I also used two fonts from Google Fonts, Dancing Scripts (h1) and Clicker Script (h2).
