===
Jordan Stoessel

https://a1-jstoessel.glitch.me

This project shows the initial creation and deployment of a Web site onto Glitch. By completing the project I am able to showcase a proper understanding of Git, Github, Text editting (HTML & CSS), and Gltich. Being that the assignment was an intro "warm-up" exercise, there will definitely be more things for me to learn.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
Added a blue color to h1
Aligned h1 text to center and h2 text to the left
Bolded "CS Major", "Psychology minor", the header "Information about Jordan Stoessel", and the 2nd header "Experience".
