## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
I used the bullet points(<ul> <li>),
       the table(<table>)
I changed the background color of the whole page and I made the color change to be gradient, as you can see that the color changes from blue to green up-down.
          the font-weight for the table
          the font-size for the table
   
   **Other HTML tags**
I used the outside link tag which directs to my e-portfolio page.
       the image tag which shows WPI logo
   **Simple JavaScript Animation**
I created a simple animation for the h1, which is "Information About Xiaowei Chen". You can see that it keeps flashing.
