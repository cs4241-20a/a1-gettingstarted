This project shows use of a css grid to display and answer the required information needed for the project. It features 2 PNG pictures I made in Microsoft Paint Freshman year. The overall style and appearance of the page is guided by the color scheme of the picture, as I based the Adobe color palette I selected off of the colors featured in the image.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
Added Style Rules for buttons, buttons on hover, unordered lists, h1, background, and a grid. These style rules, especially for the button allow a nice effect where on hover, the color of the text and background inverts.
- **JavaScript**: 
By clicking the CS4731 button, you can change the background to a smaller tiled variant of the background image.
- **CSS tag usage**: 
I used buttons, links, grids, and button hover. Grid was the most difficult of the bunch as I had to read multiple articles and view code from W3Schools and Mozilla before I was able to understand what was happening. The link I used links to the WPI page welcoming my year into WPI.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: 
I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site. This required going to an external website.
- **Used Adobe Color Palette**: 
Image of colors is included and the colors are prominently featured on the site. This was difficult because I had a look in mind that I wanted, making it difficult to find the exact combo.
