This project shows a basic website including information on my computer science education so far. 
There are also some fun computer science memes in it for some fun.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I changed the text size for p and took away the bullet points for the li.
- **Experiment with other HTML tags**: I added 3 pictures, one button and one link.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Kufam and Grandstander Font from Google Fonts**: I used kufam for the p sections and Grandstander for h1.
- **Create a color palette using color.adobe.com.**: I used the colors that can be found in a screensot in the assests file for my website. 
   These colors were used for each section an one of them for the background color.
