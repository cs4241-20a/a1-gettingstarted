This project is an introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Github, and Glitch. It involves setting up a website and deploying it to Glitch.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added style rules for the p, li, h1, h2, h3, li, div, table, and hr selectors. The style rules utilized are as follows:
    - font-family
    - color
    - background-color
    - font-weight
    - letter-spacing
    - font-size
    - margin
    - text-decoration
    - width
    - height
    - border
    - background-clip
    - padding
    - align-content
    - border-collapse
- **Added a JavaScript Animation to the Website**: Added a JavaScript Animation to create an automatic image slideshow that shows different pictures of the WPI campus and Gompei. To look at how an example slideshow was created, I looked at a demo from w3schools.com. The link is as follows: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp 
Once I looked at the slideshow on w3schools that used buttons that needed to be clicked to move to the next picture, I implemented an automatic slideshow so that the user does not have to click any buttons. There is also an image fading that is implemented so that the images transition smoothly. 
- **Added different HTML Tags to the Website**:
    - (div) I had to use two different instances of (div) in my webpage. Once to create a box around text, and once for the images in my slideshow. To differentiate between styling for two instances of (div) I used classes. These were class="personal-info" and class="slideshow-container". I created a box around text with with transparent borders. I used the link from Geeksforgeeks to learn how to create a box around text. I then created a transparent border around the text, followed by anoher colored border. These were customized to match the color theme of the page. I also had to adjust the width, margins, borders, and padding to fit the spacing of the page.

    - (img) added pictures of WPI along with figcaption

    - (table) made table for technical background, with checkmarks to showcase selected option. Customized the table for my website by making the row and colomn headers to a specific font-style and color theme that matches the website. The checkmarks were are also a custom style and color.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for elements in the body that did not have a specific font-style 
- **Used the Source Sans pro Font from Google Fonts**: I used Source Sans pro for h1, h2, and the unordered lists li
- **Used the Montserrat Font from Google Fonts**: I used Montserrat for the primary text in the body (the <p> tags)
- **Created a color palette using color.adobe.com**: I created a custome color palette from color.abode.com that suited my color theme for the website- vibrant yet professional. I included a screenshot of the palette in the images folder in the directory. All the colors from the palette were implemented into the website to style the h1, h2, h3, p, div, hr, table, marquee.
