## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: I added a drop shadow to the headers and the bulleted list to give them more depth using box-shadow. Similarly, I added an outline to the text in the headers using text-shadow and aligned them to the center of the page using text-align. I included padding on the bulleted lists on the top and bottom to give them more room.
- **Added other HTML tags**: Added two images (one .png, one .gif), an external link, and line breaks

### Design Achievements

- **Created a color palette with color.adobe.com and implemented it using CSS**: The background-color of the body, headers, and bulleted lists was changed to match the color pallette, as well as the color of the text.

- **Used the Abril Fatface and Roboto Fonts from Google Fonts**: Abril Fatface was used for the headings of the page and Roboto was used for the rest.
