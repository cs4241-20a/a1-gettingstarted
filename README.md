## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added the following CSS style rules to various CSS selectors:
    - color - Changes the color of the text.
    - background-color - Changes the color of the background of a specified element.
    - margin - Specifies a percentage of the total window width or a fixed pixel value to add a margin to the element.
    - height - Defines the total height of the selected element using a percantage or pixel value.
    - width - Defines the total width of the selected element using a percantage or pixel value.
    - opacity - Used to change the opacity of the background iamges of the header titles as well as the work logos.

- **JavaScript functions**: Added two JS functions to toggle dark mode on/off with the use of a toggle switch. On initial toggle, the activateDark function is called to change all the styling of the html to a dark palette. On toggling back, the original (light) palette is displayed.

- **Added additional pages**: Created two additional html pages and linked them in the footer of the homepage. Used external css sheet which required linking. This invovled modifying the server.js file.

- **Added responsive gauges**: Used online source to provide gauge style and modified it to suit my site. Also learned how different css attributes functioned to create these gauges.

- **Learned pseudo selectors**: Read and learned about pseudo selectors for css styling to add an opaque background image to my site headers so that the text could remain bold.

- **Hover effects**: Learned about the hover property for elements and used online source to learn how to create a hover effect over the work logos. Also used the hover property over the classes to highlight the one the user is looking at.

- **Experiment with other HTML Tags**: Added the following CSS style rules to various CSS selectors:
    - div - Used div elements within the grid containers organizing the classes, gauges, logos, and footer.
    - a - Used to link images and other hyperlinks to the page. 
    - img - Used to embed images in all the site pages.
    - abbr - Used to define abbrevations of the CS and RBE major.
    - input - Used to create the base for the toggle switch for dark mode.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Chivo, Overpass, and Abel Font from Google Fonts**: Used Chivo as the heading font for my site. Used Abel and Overpass for different portions of the body text.
- **Used analogous design palette** Used an analogous color palette for the main design of my site. Used recommended dark mode colors for the dark mode palette. The palettes used are on the linked page to the home page.
